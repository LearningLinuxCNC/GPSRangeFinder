    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

	Use your debug keystore for this key. It will only be used for debugging.
	An additional googe_maps_api.xml file will be located in the src\release\res\values directory
	that will be used for the release version of the project. It will use
	the keystore for the project.
	
	
    follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY
    string in this file.
